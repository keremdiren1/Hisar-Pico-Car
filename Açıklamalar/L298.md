## What does it do?

An H-bridge is an electronic circuit that allows a voltage to be applied across a load (like a motor) in either direction. The L298 has two H-bridges, which means it can control two DC motors independently.

### Inputs

- Input Pins (IN1–IN4): These control the state (forward, reverse, stop) of the motor.
- Enale Pins (ENA, ENB): These must be HIGH for the corresponding H-bridge to operate. They can also be used for PWM speed control.
- Output Pins (OUT1–OUT4): Connect to the motor terminals.
- Power Pins:
  - VSS: Logic voltage (typically 5V).
  - VS: Motor power supply (can be up to 46V).
  - GND: Common ground.
