Raspberry Pico 2:

- Operates at 3.3V logic.
- Powered via USB (5V).
- Supplies limited current via 3V3 pin.

L298 Motor Driver:

- Dual H-Bridge motor driver.
- Requires two power inputs:
  - Vcc (logic): 5V for internal logic.
  - Vs (motor power): 6V–12V.
- Can control two DC motors independently.
- Has significant voltage drop (1.8V–2.5V).

DC Motors:

- Typically require 6V–12V.
- Draw high starting current, sometimes up to 1A or more per motor.
