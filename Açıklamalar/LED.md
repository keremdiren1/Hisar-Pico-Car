## What is It?

LED: Light Emitting Diode

LED is something that creates light as electric flows throught it.

### Features of LED

- Diode: A semiconductor device that allows current to flow in only one direction.
- Light emission: When current passes through the diode, it releases energy in the form of photons (light).

### The Standard of Connecting a LED to a Breadboard and a Pico
