## What does it do?

An H-bridge is an electronic circuit that allows a voltage to be applied across a load (like a motor) in either direction. The L298 has two H-bridges, which means it can control two DC motors independently.

### Inputs

- Input Pins (IN1–IN4): These control the state (forward, reverse, stop) of the motor.
- Enale Pins (ENA, ENB): These must be HIGH for the corresponding H-bridge to operate. They can also be used for PWM speed control.
- Output Pins (OUT1–OUT4): Connect to the motor terminals.
- Power Pins:
  - VSS: Logic voltage (typically 5V).
  - VS: Motor power supply (can be up to 46V).
  - GND: Common ground.

### How to control turn speed and direction

- For one motor (connected between OUT1 and OUT2):
- IN1 = HIGH, IN2 = LOW → Motor turns forward.
- IN1 = LOW, IN2 = HIGH → Motor turns backward.
- IN1 = IN2 (both HIGH or LOW) → Motor stops (brakes or coasts).
- ENA must be HIGH for any output to be active. By applying a PWM signal to ENA, you can control motor speed.
